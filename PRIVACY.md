## English
This extension does not collect, store or transmit any personal data. The only data stored is your extension preferences (like "Show copy button" setting) which is saved locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. The extension requires permissions to interact with webpage elements and Chrome's clipboard for its core text selection functionality, but does not track your browsing activity or collect any information about the text you select. All extension code runs locally and no data is sent to external servers.
